    <h1>NYC -- Must-Go Spots</h1>
    <h2>(and some you must avoid)</h2>
    <h2><a href = "index.html">Back to Home</a></h2>
    <h3>The Statue of Liberty</h3>
    <p>A classic for a reason. The historical nuance surrounding
        this statue, along with the iconic nature of it make it
        a must see for any tourist. You don't have to visit it
        more than once or twice, but that very first time is magical.

    <h3>Joe's Pizza</h3>
    <p>Although Joe's Pizza is a solid spot for pizza, it is 
        not the best place to get Pizza in NYC. If you want
        an experience more close to what a local would get, I
        recommend getting dollar slice pizza or Vesuvios. Joe's 
        is overrated and overpriced for the quality of the slice.

    <h3>Viewing Deck of NYC Skyline</h3>
    <p>NYC is absolutely FAMED for it's skyline, and I think the best way
        to experience it is through a viewing deck. Although during midday they 
        can get extremely crowded, I recommend either going very early or very late.
        Although it will be busy late at night, the views of the glowing city is best
        at night.
