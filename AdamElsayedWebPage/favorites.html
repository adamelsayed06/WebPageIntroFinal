    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>Although I do enjoy coding, and computer science generally as a topic, I have a number of different interests outside of that. These include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Playing Volleyball</strong></li>
                <p>I got into playing volleyball during my junior year during my gym class. After I realized how much I enjoyed it, I began to frequent the local Pier with my friends</p>
            <li><strong>Collecting Fragrances</strong></li>
                <p> I very recently got into collecting fragrances, and despite the seemingly daunting nature of the task, given how many different fragrances there are, 
                    I began to collect. I started my collection with some fundamental scents, and as I expanded, I began to collect fragrances for a wide variety of purposes, 
                    and look at fragrances from more niche brands, such as Parfums de Marley&copy;. 
                </p>
            <li><strong>Biking Around NYC</strong></li>
                <p> After learning how to bike when I was very young, it was a skill that had remained relatively stagnant until recently. My friend and I now frequently bike around
                    our neighborhood, usually by the ocean, or we will go to downtown Brooklyn or Manhattan. I've gotten a lot more comfortable with biking recently, and has allowed
                    me to discover the city in a whole new way.
                </p>
            <li><strong>Volunteering at Community Centers</strong></li>
            <p> Volunteering at my Community Center is an activity I've found myself doing since my sophomore year of high school, and have only picked up steam since then. As of today
                I have close to 300 hours volunteering, and I find it to be a personally very rewarding activity, as it has a tangible feasible impact, and even if I'm only a small part
                of that, I am still fulfilled.
            </p>
        </ul>
