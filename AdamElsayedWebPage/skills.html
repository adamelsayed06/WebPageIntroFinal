    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
    <h2><a href = "index.html">Back to Home</a></h2>
    <p>Philosophy has been a topic that I found myself very interested in for a number of reasons
        . I found being introspective, and examining my thought process, why I thought the way I did,
        whether that be on how we attain knowledge, or my ethical framework was very interesting. However,
        there is a lot of fluff, and books that are either incomprehensible or I just don't think are worth reading. If
         you are looking to get into philosophy here are the books I recommend for you to begin with. 
         <table>
            <th> <strong>Ethics 101</strong>
                <td>A great introduction to basic thought experiments and
                    different moral frameworks.
                </td>
              </th>
              <br>
            <th><strong>Knowledge, Reality, and Value&copy; by Michael Huemer</strong>  </th>
            <td>A general common sense guide to philosophy that most people
                will resonate with. A classic contemporary masterpiece.
